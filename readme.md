The image to the right shows Kelvin Kiptum during his world record run at the 2023 Chicago marathon. Elite marathon runners such as him typically have a $\dot{V}O_2$ maximum exceeding 80 ml/kg/minute. For reference, healthy, untrained men typically have a $\dot{V}O_2$ maximum in the range of 35-40 ml/kg/minute.<br>

For a hisory on the notorious "super shoes" that have shaped distance running record worldwide, please see [Super Shoe History](./docs/supershoe_history.md).

<p> Some say that Kiptum's favorite colour is $\color{red}{\text{red}}$ but I don't know if that is actually true. "Some" is me and I just made that up but who knows maybe he does like red.
